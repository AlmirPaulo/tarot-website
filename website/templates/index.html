                <h2>What is the Tarot?</h2>
                <p>Basically, it's a deck of 78 cards composed by 22 cards named as Major Arcana and 56 named as Minor Arcana.</p>
                <p>There is a lot of different conceptions about what the Tarot really is. In my point of view, the Tarot is an amazing tool to help you in your self-knowledge journey.</p>
                <p>Here, for now, we are dealing only with the Major Arcana. But that's enough. The Major Arcana, arguably, carry the most deep and philosophical meanings. Certainly, what we need in our endeavor.</p>

                            <p>Once you click the button "Get your guidance", you will be redirected to a random page with a card image and a few questions to help you read the card by yourself. Don't worry, you will answer this question for yourself, by yourself and there are no wrong answers.</p>
                            <p>Feel free to use your background knowledge of Astrology, Alchemy and Kabbalah if you have some. It will be very useful.</p>
